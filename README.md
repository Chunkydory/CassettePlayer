# CassettePlayer
A soundcloud frontend player that looks like an old tapedeck.

This little javascript thingy connects to Soundcloud using the login data described in tapeplayer.js (currently set to display
the great Sufjan Steven's "The BQE") and displays the playlist in a tapedeck/player form. ;)
